Attributes like action and method to specify how and where the form data will be sent.

action: The URL where form data will be sent.
method:
GET: Appends form data to the URL (useful for search queries or when data isn't sensitive).
POST: Sends data in the HTTP request body (useful for secure or large data). -->
